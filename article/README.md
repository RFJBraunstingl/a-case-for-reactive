## ToDo
- add simple Quarkus implementation and compare results without load
- add locust tests and test resource consumption under load
- add reactive spring implementation and compare results
- add reactive quarkus implementation and compare results
- compile quarkus to native and compare results
- test spring native resource consumption

Factors to compare:
- reactive vs. non-reactive
- JVM vs. native
- spring vs. quarkus
